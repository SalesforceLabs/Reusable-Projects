# Reusable-Projects
All the magic of Milestones PM, except now, you have the ability to clone any existing project into a new project with the same Milestones, Tasks, and Timelines.

With the combination of Process Builder and Flow, any Closed Won Opportunity with a "Clone from Project" and "Kickoff Date" values will spin up a brand new project. The new project will begin on the designated kickoff date, and include all of the same Milestones and Tasks from the source Project.

This makes it possible to build a catalog of Project templates, and effortless to repurpose past project definitions for future work.

Enjoy!
